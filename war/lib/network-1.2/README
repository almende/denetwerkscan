DESCRIPTION

Links Network is an interactive chart to visualize networks.
It allows creating nodes, links between the nodes, and interactive packages
moving between nodes. 
The visualization supports custom styles, colors, sizes, images, and more. 

The network visualization works smooth on any modern browser for up to a 
few hundred nodes and connections.

Network is developed as a Google Visualization Chart in javascript. 
There is a GWT wrapper available to use the Network in GWT (Google Web Toolkit).

It runs on all modern browsers without additional requirements. 
Network is tested on Firefox 3.6+, Safari 5.0+, Chrome 6.0+, Opera 10.6+, 
Internet Explorer 9+.


USAGE

Network is no built-in visualization of Google. To load Network, download the 
file network.zip, and unzip it in your html page such that the files are located 
in a subfolder network. Include the google API and the following files in the 
head of your html code:

    <script type="text/javascript" src="http://www.google.com/jsapi"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="network/network.js"></script> 

The google visualization API needs to be loaded in order to use DataTable.

    google.load("visualization", "1");
    google.setOnLoadCallback(drawVisualization);
    function drawVisualization() {
      // load data and create the network here
    }

The class name of the Network is links.Network

    var network = new links.Network(container);

After being loaded, the network can be drawn via the function draw(), provided 
with data and options.

    network.draw(nodes, links, packages, options);

where nodes, links, and packages are a DataTable, and options is a name-value 
map in the JSON format. Both links and packages are optional.
